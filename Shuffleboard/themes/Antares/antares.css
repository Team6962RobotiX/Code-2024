/*
 * A variation on the builtin Midnight theme, swapping blues and purples for reds.
 * This theme is merely to display that the builtin themes can be customized and
 * how custom themes can be provided by plugins, and is not in any way indicative
 * of the limits of customizing those themes - for details on the builtin themes,
 * look at the material.css and base.css files in the API project and the
 * light.css, dark.css, and midnight.css files in the app project on GitHub, as
 * well as the JavaFX CSS reference:
